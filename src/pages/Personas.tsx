                    <p>For this assignment, we observed real users interacting with a
                        public interface. We interviewed these individuals about their
                        experiences, designed personas based on these users, and
                        created a storyboard for one of the personas.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className="section">
                    <Heading title="Interface"></Heading>
                    <p>
                        For my public interface, I chose the display control panel found
                        in most CIT (the computer science building at Brown) classrooms. This panel is usually mounted to the wall
                        and controls the projector and TV monitors in the room that a user can connect their computer to. It's
                        often used by professors for presenting slides during class and by
                        students for personal use outside of class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The default homepage for the display control panel is the basic mode page.
                        On this page, users can select the primary display mode. There is also an advanced mode
                        page for specific display settings.
                    </p>
                    <div className="img-container">
                        <Image src={basic} caption="Basic mode homepage"></Image>
                        <Image src={advanced} caption="Advanced mode homepage"></Image>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The advanced mode page has 4 specific settings controls, 2 of which are important for connecting and
                        displaying the contents on a laptop.
                        On the display controls page, users can turn the projector on, lower the projector screen, and turn the monitors on.
                        On the audio/visual routing display page, users can select the display source and destination.
                    </p>
                    <div className="img-container">

                    <p>
                        Together, all of these components make up the display control panel. A user must visit each page and select
                        the right settings to successfully connect their computer to the projector screen.
                    </p>

                    <Heading title="Observations"></Heading>
                    <p>I observed 3 users using the display control panel to
                        connect their computers to the projector screen. The main takeaways were:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="observations">
                        <li>üìå Not all users immediately clicked on the advanced settings
                            option, which was the correct next step. There was noticeably
                            a few seconds of hesitation among all users before they clicked on the advanced settings icon located at the top right of the screen.
                        </li>
                        <li>üìå On the display control screen, all users had no trouble turning the projector on and
                            setting the projector screen to the down position. Some users also turned the monitor on,
                            which was not necessary (the monitor on button refers to the TV monitor, not the projector in any way).
                        </li>
                        <li>üìå On the audio/visual routing page, users followed the two step instructions on the screen,
                            working from top to bottom. For the select your source step, users correctly tapped the
                            laptop option. For the assign your destination step, users showed slight hesitation.
                            Users read through the different options for a few seconds, then tapped the projector
                            option. They kept tapping it until it toggled to the laptop option. Some users also
                            set the monitor option to laptop, which was not necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>üìå All users used the back button on the display control and audio/visual
                            screens to return to the advanced settings homepage, rather than clicking
                            on the advanced settings icon again.

                                <li>Most users felt that the home screen was simple and easy to use.</li>
                                <li>Users said that since there were only 3 main options, each with an icon and a clear labels, selecting the laptop option was a clear first step.</li>
                                <li>Some users noted that the interface was similar to the interface for Apple devices.</li>

                                <li>Some users claimed that the advanced settings button was too small and tucked away, so it was not immediately obvious that a
                                    user has to click on the advanced settings button to progress.</li>
                                <li>Some users pointed out the empty space surrounding the three main icons on the basic mode homepage and said that the icons could be
                                    bigger to fill the empty space.</li>
                                <li>One user disliked the distinction between basic mode and advanced mode and said that it was misleading because a user must use
                                    both setting modes to connect their computer.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Users would add an instruction on the basic settings homepage to direct others towards the advanced settings mode.</li>
                                <li>Otherwise, users suggested merging the basic and advanced settings homepages, since a user would need to visit both anyway.</li>
                                <li>Users would make the main three icons on the basic settings homepage bigger to fill the empty space.</li>

                                <li>Some users said that they didn't expect the interface for the display control panel to be similar
                                    to the UI for Apple products. It was more familiar and modern than they expected.</li>
                                <li>Some users said that the process was easier than they initially thought and admitted that
                                    they since they had connected once, they can easily do it again in the future.</li>
                                <li>Users who explored the display panel further said that they did not expect there to be so many

                                    and starting a Zoom room.</li>

                            he is not too familiar with the interface found on modern devices. This given persona represents the new
